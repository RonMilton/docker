# Web Overview

The DITA-OT provides HTML transformations out of the box, so why Jekyll?

* GitHub Pages. Free hosting and simple site updates are a definite bonus.
* Jekyll is purposefully built for Markdown. Markdown support for DITA (LWDITA) is prelimenary.
* Integrated tools to help development.
