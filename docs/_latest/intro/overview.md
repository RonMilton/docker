# Overview

{{site.data.project.project-name}} is an end-to-end documentation solution powered by a completely free tooolchain.  

**Web**

Jekyll generates the websites, both locally and on GitHub Pages. You can spin up a local copy with Docker and Node to view the effect your changes will have on the site before pushing to production. A push to the Master branch will cause GitHub to generate the published online version - {{site.url}}.

**Print**

DITA-OT handles the print functionality. The output is completely customizable but you will need to be comfortable with editing XML stylesheets and files. 

Jekyll will actually create a website for print production, as well, using a dedicated configuration file. The print website will generate well-formed files the DITA-OT needs to generate PDFs.  

**Editing**

[Prose.io](http://prose.io) provides a minimalist online editor that provides a pleasant editing experience. GitHub's online editor works, too, of course.
